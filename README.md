The data set can be accessed from the resource http://data.gov.uk/.
The data set is published by 'Department for Transport' under the open government license. The data under consideration is collected using the 'STATS19' accident reporting form.

We analyze the UK accident dataset from 2005 to 2012 using different mining techniques such as Classification, Clustering and Random forest algorithms that will help to analyze the factors affecting the severity of road accidents.
